# #This repository contains the project for a mock website, which serves as a database for managing courses. The project includes test cases for CRUD operations and edge cases, along with a bug report for another website and a usability test report for a different application.

# Project Structure
# The repository is organized as follows:

# ├── BDD_feature/
# │   ├── Manage_Course_Edge_Cases.feature
# │   ├── Manage_Courses_with_Edge_cases.feature
# │   ├── Manage_Couses_CRUD.feature
# │   └── Manage_Couses_CRUD1.feature
# ├── Selenium_script_test_cases/
# │   ├── Manage_Course_Regtest_EdgeCase1.py
# ├── bug_report/
# │   ├── bug_report.md
# ├── usability_test_report/
# │   ├── usability_test_report.md
# ├── README.md

# The BDD_feature directory contains individual markdown files for each CRUD operation as well as edge cases: create, read, update, and delete. These files provide detailed test cases for each operation, covering various scenarios and validations.

# The Selenium_script_test_cases directory includes a markdown file that outlines the test cases derived from BDD into actual selenium webdriver scripts. These test cases explore site's behavior in extreme and boundary scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability for the website "https://content-providers.herokuapp.com/".

# The bug_report directory contains a bug report for another website. The report highlights a specific issue identified during testing and provides comprehensive details, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and observed results.

# The usability_test_report directory consists of a usability test report for a different application. The report documents the findings from usability testing sessions, including user feedback, observations, and recommendations for improving the user experience.

# How to Use
# To access the test cases, bug report, and usability test report, navigate to the respective directories and open the corresponding markdown files. These files contain all the relevant information related to the project deliverables.

# Feel free to review the test cases to gain an understanding of the comprehensive testing approach used for the CRUD operations and edge cases. The bug report and usability test report provide insights into identifying and resolving issues and improving the user experience.
